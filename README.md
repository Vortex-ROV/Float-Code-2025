# Float-Code-2025
This repository contains the software code for the new float. The vertical profiling float is designed to collect data from various depths of a water column. It uses this code to control its buoyancy, navigate vertical profiles, and collect sensor. The floatâ€™s software ensures smooth operation, data logging, and communication with surface stations.
